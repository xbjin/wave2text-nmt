# Acknowledgment
This work is based on an existing implementation [(seqseq)](https://github.com/eske/seq2seq) of a recent proof of concept english-to-french direct translation study [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01744v1.pdf).  

# Wave2text-nmt
Current work, will build english(wave)-to-chinese(text) neural machine translation system, and evaluation on over thousand hours of real speech data. 

The highlight of this work:
- English(wave)-to-chinese(text) end to end translation.
- Develop system over 1000 hours of translated real audio data.
- To be added more.
